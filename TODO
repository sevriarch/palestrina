HIGH PRIORITY:

FEATURES:
- MusicXML import/export

ERROR HANDLING:
- Review (including type checking)

DOCUMENTATION:
- There should be more non-API documentation
 - README.md should gain guided examples of how to create a score
 - Backfill ADRs
 - Keep dictionary up to date
- Determine if we can easily replace terms in the documentation with the class they're already in, eg: Collection->ChordSeq


LOW PRIORITY:

ERROR HANDLING:
- Error-checking on arrays should show a list of failing members/indices
 - This is a major undertaking that would require the order: MetaList, ChordSeqMember, Sequences

BUGS/DESIGN ISSUES:
- Nested .if()/.while()s will be unpredictable unless we implement using a stack.
- sliding window methods are implemented in an unintuitive manner

MIDI:
- many changes done, could review these
- midi-reader could potentially attempt to associate events with the related note(s) and/or collapse chords into one event.

VISUALISATIONS:
- The original Score canvas could use some love and some compatibility with the 2D canvas style
- SVG as an alternative to canvas

CLEANLINESS:
- Perhaps move helpers around and use the term only for those available to the end user?

ONCE DONE:
- Review docs, compile checklist of things to rereview
