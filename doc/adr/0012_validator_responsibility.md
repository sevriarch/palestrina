# The responsibility for validation lies with Sequences, not SeqMembers.

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The current implementation places the responsibility of validation on SeqMembers, not on Sequences, in an attempt to reduce the need for revalidating the content of Sequences when they are constructed.

This adds complexity and unnecessary indirection because validation rules are a property of a Sequence itself and a different members of the sequence containing different validation rules would be a very niche case. SeqMembers should be dumb containers for values with standard manipulation methods attached for ease of use.

In addition, the performance increase generated by not revalidating the content of Sequences is very minor and more than offset by the additional performance required by revalidating on a SeqMember level and requiring every SeqMember to include a validator.

## Decision

- We should move all validation to Sequences. SeqMembers should be dumb and unaware of the validation rules associated with them (Hi, I'm a SeqMember, I dombt thimk).

## Consequences

- Significant simplification of SeqMember code will be possible.
- Validation logic will be centralised in one place.
 - This may later permit improvement of the validator system, which is somewhat clunky.
- Sequence modification operations will be around 3-5% faster than before.
